When comparing pot's SCEPTICesque reinjection algorithm to SCEPTIC's own
output, some basic SCEPTIC settings that work for making a fair comparison
are
	./sceptic -nr100 -nt100 -l99 -ni1000000 -p0 --bcphi0 -v0 2> reinj.dat
which gets SCEPTIC to simulate a million ions without drift, with the central
sphere/grain fixed to zero potential, and a very long Debye length so that
that central zero potential extends to the edge. Also, by default, SCEPTIC's
ion velocity components are sqrt(2) bigger than pot's, so allow for that.

When simulating with drift, one has to convince SCEPTIC to use the same
temperature scale as pot, by adding the -t0.5 flag (i.e. T_e / T_i = 0.5):
	./sceptic -nr100 -nt100 -l99 -ni1000000 -p0 --bcphi0 -t0.5 -v2
which in this case has SCEPTIC using a drift velocity of twice the ion
thermal velocity. Tests like this indicate that pot successfully mimics
SCEPTIC's reinjection procedure with drift (but negligible edge potential).

Final command line I used when comparing my reinjection code against
SCEPTIC's output:
	./sceptic -s300 -x9 -nr99 -nt99 -l4 -ni3600000 -p0 --bcphi0 -t0.5 -v1 \
		2> reinj-sample.dat
